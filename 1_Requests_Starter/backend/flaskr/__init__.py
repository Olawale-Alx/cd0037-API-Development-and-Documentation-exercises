# @TODO: General Instructions
#   - As you're creating endpoints, define them and then search for 'TODO' within the frontend to update the endpoints there.
#     If you do not update the endpoints, the lab will not work - of no fault of your API code!
#   - Make sure for each route that you're thinking through when to abort and with which kind of error
#   - If you change any of the response body keys, make sure you update the frontend to correspond.
